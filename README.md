# Sandhya Paladugu 
###### Indian Cricket 

When cricket's on, everything comes to a **standstill**.

No matter how important an exam or meeting one has on the next day, the Indian cricket fan takes the time out to keep tabs on his favourite team's match.<br>It seems even more challenging for an entire team to work towards the same goal, complement each others' strengths and weaknesses and share the woes and throes of **defeat and victory**.
